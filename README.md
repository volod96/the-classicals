Developing a Single Page Application for classical music enthusiasts

### Why?
Because classical music and its fans deserve so much more!

### What can I do with it?
Well, let's see:
* Find your favourite composers, go through their lives, works, official Opus numbers and (hopefully) watch their masterpieces being played on [Youtube](www.youtube.com);
* Research some of the most renowned classical music artists of today, including a few biographical data and listen to their best performances;
* Build your own Composers, Artists, and/or Songs Sheet to access your preferred content as quickly as possible.

### I'm not impressed!
I bet you'll be when you learn about our feature called `Advanced Song Search`, which provides you with a mean of finding songs which
contain a sequence of given tones; you may also spot how often this sequence has been used in songs over the years on a chart. This 
is thanks to [Peachnote](www.peachnote.com).
Perfect if a have a small piece of music stuck in your head, like most of us do!

### Sounds cool. Where do I find it?
